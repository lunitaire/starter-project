This is a project meant to be a starting point for other web development projects.

It contains the following basics:

- README.md
- .gitignore
- css/ with app.css
- js/ with app.js
- img/ with default favicon.png


## project status

Project will only be updated when changes are made to workflow that influences all web development projects.

## design notes

- Influenced by [the udacity/course-git-blog-project](https://github.com/udacity/course-git-blog-project), but I wanted to make my own.
- Based on workflow used on [my dev-portfolio project.](https://github.com/lunitaire/dev-portfolio)
- Since it is based on a project that I created for a Udacity class, it follows Udacity's style guides for HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git.
